# How Green is the Energy we use? 
Creating a dashboard for tracking global low-carbon energy consumption and its impact on carbon emissions.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard for tracking the adoption and evolution of low-carbon energy sources (i.e. hydro, nuclear, wind, solar) across the world and throughout the years.


### Methods Used
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data preparation and wrangling
* Setting KPIs
* Descriptive statistics   
* Data visualization

### Technologies
* SQL
* BigQuery
* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter
* Tableau
* Google Cloud


## Project Description
The main goal of the project was to create a tool to track the growth and evolution of low-carbon energy throughout the world. Additionally, the aim was to explore the data further and test a few hypotheses regarding the use of clean energy sources and their impact on overall CO2 emissions. 

To answer these questions and to develop insights for further validation, an exploratory data analysis was conducted with SQL using Google BigQuery - [the queries and scripts can be found here](https://github.com/hafluz/data-insights/blob/main/How_Green_is_the_Energy_We_Use_v4.ipynb).

Afterward, a dashboard with the most insightful KPIs and visualizations was built using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalEnergyConsumptionDashboard/HOWGREENISTHEENERGYWEUSE?:language=pt-BR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). 

There was also an effort to integrate the entire process in the cloud, starting with the dataset hosted on Google Cloud, going through BigQuery, Python on Google Colaboratory, Google Drive and finally being visualized on Tableau.


### Steps
