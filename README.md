## Project Description
The main goal of the project was to create a tool to track the growth and evolution of low-carbon energy (i.e. hydro, nuclear, wind, solar) throughout the world. Additionally, the aim was to explore the data further and test a few hypotheses regarding the use of clean energy sources and their relationship with overall CO2 emissions and other key economic indicators. 

To answer these questions and to develop insights for further validation, descriptive and diagnostic data analytics were imployed with SQL using Google BigQuery - [the queries and scripts can be found here](https://github.com/hafluz/energy_data/blob/main/energy_python.ipynb).

Afterward, the [dashboard above](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalEnergyConsumptionDashboard/HOWGREENISTHEENERGYWEUSE?:language=pt-BR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) was built with Tableau using the most insightful KPIs and visualizations.

There was also an effort to integrate and sync the entire process in the cloud, beginning with the datasets being hosted on Google Cloud, querying with BigQuery, automating with Python to export dataframes to Google Drive, and finally data syncing with Tableau to build and share visualizations.Â
